# The Quacks Of Quedlinburg Tools

Out of the box, The Quacks Of Quedlinburg has its core mechanic - random drawing of tokens - completely unusable without frustration. The bags have sharp corners where the tokens get stuck and the cartboard is too light to allow the player to mix properly. This project aims at mitigating those negative effects by providing a UI for drawing your tokens, which assures randomness and fairness.

## About the project

The project is developed using Quasar, Vue3 and TypeScript. If you want to work on the codebase, you would need knowledge in all of those.

Currently, only Android is supported, but you could pull the project and build for other platforms.

The release app is not signed. However, the pipeline that builds and publishes it is available within the repository, as well as the full soure code used to build it.

## Features

- Free mode where you can pick any chips you want and draw them.
- Game mode where you go through 9 rounds.
  - On each round you can draw as many chips as you want but you cannot reset.
  - At the end of the round you proceed to the shop, where you can buy maximum 2 chips.
  - You cannot buy two chips of the same type.
  - Chips that are not supposed to be available in the current round are not displayed.
  - You cannot change the quantity of the white chips.
  - One white chip is added automatically on the 6th turn.

## Usage

### Technical

Download the APK file on your phone and install it. You will need to allow installation from unknown sources. Pick a mode. Currently there is game mode and free mode.

### In-Game

Instead of putting your chips in the bag, leave them on the board. Use the app to draw a chip. Then pick the corresponding chip from the pile and place it on your board.

### Known limitations

- The current version of the tool does not have any game rules in it, which means that you will have to put token in your bag to draw chips at random at some point. For example, this happens when you draw a blue in the first variant of the game (then you need to draw N chips at random and pick one).
- You will get annoying messages that ask you to confirm going forwards. That's better than ruining your game.
- If you want to start a new game, you have to restart the app.

## Code Walkthrough

Most of the project is autogenerated by the Quasar CLI. The code you should be looking at is inside the src/components directory. The token data can be found in src/assets. It is then loaded and visualized. Simple addition and subtraction of tokens is available, as well as a drawing function.
