# The Quacks Of Quedlinburg Tools

Out of the box, The Quacks Of Quedlinburg has its core mechanic - random drawing of tokens - completely unusable without frustration. This project aims at drawing providing a basic UI for drawing your tokens, which assures randomness and fairness.

## About the project

The project is developed using Quasar, Vue3 and TypeScript. If you want to work on the codebase, you would need knowledge in all of those.

## Code Walkthrough

Most of the project is autogenerated by the Quasar CLI. The code you should be looking at is inside the src/components directory. The token data can be found in src/assets. It is then loaded and visualized. Simple addition and subtraction of tokens is available, as well as a drawing function.

## Using the releases

The release is in the form of an .apk file for debugging purposes. In the future I might consider signing it properly if there is a need for that.
